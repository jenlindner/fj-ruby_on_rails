Intro - enough ruby to do the exercises with: variables, methods, puts, hashes.



1. Tests -- could start with this. it will be the method we're using in all the exercises. 
Give example of BDD, have a test that won't work until there's a method they have 
to write that makes it work. Something relevant to user experience.

2. Gems and Bundle

a hash that contains sets of gems; a bundle method that will choke on incompatible versions, 
requires updating. can the gems change anything visible in whatevethe demo app is?

3. Rake and scaffold

4. Rails

regexes that represent controller actions maybe, and converting variables into tags 

5. ORM

a method that migrates up a table, adds column, adds an association. methods that return
properties showing the new column and association.

6. MVC

7. Security

session = {}

session[:user_id] = "innocent_bystander"

puts 'hello jen'
puts session

#write method to try to hijack a session

csrf = "Z%F%^&%^CTYFTR%^$%X^TRDFGDE%^E"

#write method that won't return success unless passed this

8. Optimization
