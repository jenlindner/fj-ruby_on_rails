session = {}

session[:user_id] = "innocent_bystander"

puts 'hello jen'
puts session

#write method to try to hijack a session

csrf = "Z%F%^&%^CTYFTR%^$%X^TRDFGDE%^E"

#write method that won't return success unless passed this

a hash that contains sets of gems; a bundle method that will choke on incompatible versions, requires updating. can the gems change anything visible in whatevethe demo app is?
